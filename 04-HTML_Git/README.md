Bedroom Finishing Touches
Review by Christine on 18 Oct 2020 reviews stating that Urban Interieurs I worked with my wonderful designer Jacinth to finish off my master - she knew exactly the vibe I was going for and listened to exactly what I wanted, even revising several times based on size and a change I made towards the end. First time using Havenly and I was so very happy!</P>

She worked extremely well with the items I wanted to build off of and gave me wonderful options in my budget. Will definitely be using this service again!</p>
